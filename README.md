# Lucy
University Mini Project

As a Part of my university miniproject , I chose to do a virtual voice assistant , 
From now on i will refer her as Lucy.
I went through a lot of time to discover the working principle of a voice assistant and its functions.

let's know how it works , 

Normally a Voice Assistant consists of,

1.Speech To Text Engine (STT)
2.NLP Processor
3.Text To Speech (TTS)

Main goal of this Project is to Implement a working voice assistant in Tamil Language , as current assistants lack fluency and accuracy in a conversation.

And i also wanna implement an ml algorithm that would increase the accuracy of the model when mimicking Human Conversation Pattern.

In this Project , I took the first part which is "Speech To Text Engine", i wanna implement this without any external frameworks and mainly only with C++ as optimization of algorithms Plays a crucial part in this project .

The Proposed Speech Recognition System Consists of, 
1.Feature Extraction.
2.Feature Mapping.
3.Ngram Model for Prediction of Letters and Words.
